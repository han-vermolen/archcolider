# Question to the Owner 

## Subscribers 

1. If subscriber can form a menu, then what is the maximum period of ordering upfront? A week, 2 weeks, a month?
2. Can subscriber cancel scheduled menu? When it should be accepted? What is the notice period? 
3. What if subscriber didn't grab daily meal, can it be sold to others? After what time? How does subscriber will be notified about it? 
4. What if subscriber get sick and can't grab meals for a one\several days?

## Ghost Kitchen 

1. How often shoud the kitchen get updates about on-demand orders and consumed meals? We are assuming that the kitchen do not work 24/7 and delivery also take time and scheduled in some way or another. Also it's related to supply refil for the kitchen, that's why this is important question. 

## Meal reservation and "on-demand" ordering 

1. Can registered users create a batch order that won't fit in a fridge? What then? Direct delivery? 
2. What is the system behaviour if the catalog of meals become stale and a user ordered out of stock for a particular fridge meal?  
3. What is the time frame for the "on-demand" ordering? We think that it is a legal case when the catalog shows a meal that can be cooked, but for now out of stock. And user can order it for delivery. For instance: if I order a meal at the morning, can I get it during a lunch? Or all on-demand orders can be executed only at the next day? 

## Distribution
1. Are there (peak) times at which customers want to pick up their food from a fridge? If so, what are those times and is there an identified pattern for them? (ie. 6 pm on monday - thursday but 7:30 pm on weekend days or are there peaks on the weekend and slower times during the week?)
2. Can the above question also be answered for the ghost kitchens? Are there peak times for them? Can you elaborate a bit on the subject.
3. How does the ghost kitchen currently optimize their work for distribution? (ie. pre-cook for 3 days, cook on demand?)



## General clarification 

1. We had a feeling that following requirements out of scope of the Ordering system (it even sound like an environment description): 
- Must integrate with 3rd party smart fridges to obtain inventory and purchase activity
- Smart Fridges Produce item inventory levels and purchases. The smart fridges have a cloud based management system that handles communication with the Smart Fridge so obtaining this data would be through an API.
Because during the introductionary session, it was mentioned that smart-fridge system totaly independent of the required one and already established. So the smart-fridges system provide API for all of them. Could you please clarify it? Do we right or there some other intentions behind those sentences?
